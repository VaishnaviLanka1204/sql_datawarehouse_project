# sql_datawarehouse_project
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold layers). The goal is to create a scalable, efficient, and analytics-ready data pipeline for transforming raw business data into meaningful insights.

🧩 Architecture: Medallion Layers
🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data Ingestion

Collects raw, unprocessed data from multiple sources (CSV, API, transactional DB).

Data is stored in its original format for traceability.

SQL scripts are used to load and validate data structure.

🥈 Silver Layer — Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performs data cleaning, handling nulls, duplicates, and schema mismatches.

Joins, filters, and applies business rules to standardize data.

Outputs curated, relationally consistent datasets ready for analytics.

🥇 Gold Layer — Analytics & Reporting

Aggregates and enriches data for dashboards, KPIs, and advanced analytics.

Supports BI tools (Power BI / Tableau) for visual reporting.

Enables data-driven decision-making with high-quality insights.

🧠 Key Features

✅ Implementation of the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
✅ Efficient ETL pipeline design using SQL.
✅ Use of stored procedures, CTEs, and views for modular transformations.
✅ Data quality checks and schema enforcement.
✅ Optimized query performance using indexing and partitioning.
✅ Business-ready datasets for analytics and dashboards.

🚀 How It Works

Load raw data into the Bronze Layer.

Clean and transform data in the Silver Layer using SQL scripts.

Aggregate and model data in the Gold Layer for reporting.

Connect Power BI/Tableau to the Gold Layer for visual analytics.

📊 Use Case Example

This architecture can be applied to:

Retail Sales Data Warehousing

Healthcare Data Integration

Financial Transaction Analytics

Supply Chain Performance Tracking

Customer Behavior Analysis

📈 Expected Outcomes

Reliable, clean, and structured data layers.

Improved query performance and data consistency.

Seamless integration with BI tools for visualization.

Foundation for machine learning and predictive analytics in the future.

🧾 Future Enhancements

Automate ETL workflows using Azure Data Factory or Airflow.

Implement Delta Tables for versioned data.

Integrate real-time streaming data using Kafka or Synapse Pipelines.
